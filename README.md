# QCDC
A tool for inspecting quantum circuits step by step. It displays each gate layer as a matrix operator acting on the current system state, and then shows the resulting state after the operation. This makes it easy to trace, debug, and understand the evolution of a quantum system layer by layer.

The repository contains two files:
<br>
#
QCDC.py: Provides the ready-to-use print_submatrices function, which implements the core functionality
#
Use_Case.ipynb: A simple example notebook demonstrating how to use print_submatrices on a sample quantum circuit.
